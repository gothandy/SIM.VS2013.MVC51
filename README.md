SIM Package - Visual Studio 2013 MVC 5.1 Project
================================================

Sitecore SIM Visual Studio 2013 MVC 5.1 Project custom package.

The Website solution is used for making changes in Visual Studio.

These are then manually copied to 'Visual Studio 2013 MVC 5.1 Website Project' from which the zip file is created.

WARNING currently unable to get the manifest file working with SIM. For temporary workaround use the 'Visual Studio 2012 Website Project' zip and manifest.xml files and overwrite those found in your SIM\Packages file. Don't forget to back those up if you need them.
